# Description:

This repository contains my <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/raw/main/filter.txt">extended filter</a> - the compilation of filters for AdGuard Home that blocks:
- Advertising, CPA and banner domains and their subdomains💩
- Tracking and telemetry hosts and their subdomains📡
- CNAME cloaking, analytics and metric domains and their subdomains🕵
- Chat, cookies and push services hosts and their subdomains🔕
- Some adware, spyware and malware domains and their subdomains🤬

You can use it any way you want. The file will be updated regularly🚀

# Note:

This filter is optimized for use <b>ONLY</b> in AdGuard Home🛡️Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/issues/new">contact me</a> with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blocked🙋
