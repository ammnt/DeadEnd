# Description:

This repository contains my <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/raw/main/filter.txt">extended filter</a> - the compilation of filters for AdGuard Home that blocks:
- Advertising, CPA and banner domains and their subdomainsğŸ’©
- Tracking and telemetry hosts and their subdomainsğŸ“¡
- CNAME cloacking, analytics and metric domains and their subdomainsğŸ•µ
- Chat, cookies and push services hosts and their subdomainsğŸ”•
- Some adware, spyware and malware domains and their subdomainsğŸ¤¬

You can use it any way you want. The file will be updated regularlyğŸš€ You can also use my public DNS-over-HTTPS server with this filter:
<code>https://dns.msftcnsi.com/dns-query/2abb6344</code>

# Note:

This filter is optimized for use <b>ONLY</b> in AdGuard HomeğŸ›¡Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/issues/new">contact me</a> with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blockedğŸ™‹
