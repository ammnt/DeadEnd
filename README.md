# Description:

This repository contains my <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/raw/main/filter.txt">extended filter</a> - the compilation of filters for AdGuard Home that blocks:
- Advertising, CPA and banner domains and their subdomainsðŸ’©
- Tracking and telemetry hosts and their subdomainsðŸ“¡
- CNAME cloacking, analytics and metric domains and their subdomainsðŸ•µ
- Chat, cookies and push services hosts and their subdomainsðŸ”•
- Some adware, spyware and malware domains and their subdomainsðŸ¤¬

You can use it any way you want. The file will be updated regularlyðŸš€ You can also use my public DNS-over-HTTPS server with this filter:<br>
<code>https://dns.msftcnsi.com/dns-query/fbd15f6c</code>
or:
<code>sdns://AgEAAAAAAAAADTEwNC4yMS44OC4xNDYAEGRucy5tc2Z0Y25zaS5jb20TL2Rucy1xdWVyeS9mYmQxNWY2Yw</code>

# Note:

This filter is optimized for use <b>ONLY</b> in AdGuard HomeðŸ›¡Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/issues/new">contact me</a> with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blockedðŸ™‹
