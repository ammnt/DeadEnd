# Contributing

First off all, thanks for being here and showing your support to the project !

We accept many types of contributions whether they are technical or not. Every community feedback, work or help is, and will always be, appreciated.

## Reporting bugs / ask for features

The preferred way to report bugs and asking for features is using [issues](https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/issues). Before opening a new one, please check if a related issue is already opened.

## Code contribution

The preferred way to contribute code is using [pull requests](https://github.com/ammnt/DeadEnd/pulls). Before creating a pull request, please check if your code is related to an opened issue. If that's not the case, you should first create an issue so we can discuss about it. This procedure is here to avoid wasting your time in case the PR will be rejected. For minor changes (e.g. : typo, quick fix, ...), opening an issue might be facultative. **Don't forget to edit the documentations when needed !**
